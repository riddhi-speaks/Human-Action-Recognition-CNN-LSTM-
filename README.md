# Human-Action-Recognition-CNN-LSTM-
This repository implements a Human Action Recognition (HAR) system using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network
Human Action Recognition with CNN-LSTM (HAR-CNN-LSTM)
Goal: Develop a model to automatically classify human actions in video sequences.
Method:
CNNs: Learn spatial features from individual video frames, identifying relevant patterns within each frame.
LSTMs: Capture the temporal relationships between these features, understanding the flow of the action across frames.
